# Reports Dashboard with Next.js

Deployed to https://report-dashboard-nextjs.vercel.app/

Example project of a dashboard showing different reports, using Next.js / TypeScript / Redux

### Technical details

* Next.JS with TypeScript
* Redux toolkit for state
* Mantine UI library (for example)

## Assumptions

* We would need to make some user research: requirements, profile of users, context of use, ...
* User profile (let's say):
  * technical (somehow)
  * more interested in data than in aesthetics (but graphics are important)

* if coming from an existing app => study and define strong points and problems in it

## Mockup

 ![Balsamiq mockup](/public/images/mockups.png)

## ToDo

* Improve visuals
* Tests (unit / e2e)
* Errors handling
* Persistence

# TypeScript Next.js example

This is a really simple project that shows the usage of Next.js with TypeScript.

## Deploy your own

Deploy the example using [Vercel](https://vercel.com?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=next-example) or preview live with [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/github/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-typescript)

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/git/external?repository-url=https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-typescript&project-name=with-typescript&repository-name=with-typescript)

## How to use it?

Execute [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) with [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/init) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/create/) to bootstrap the example:

```bash
npx create-next-app --example with-typescript with-typescript-app
# or
yarn create next-app --example with-typescript with-typescript-app
# or
pnpm create next-app -- --example with-typescript with-typescript-app
```

Deploy it to the cloud with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/new?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=next-example) ([Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment)).

## Notes

This example shows how to integrate the TypeScript type system into Next.js. Since TypeScript is supported out of the box with Next.js, all we have to do is to install TypeScript.

```
npm install --save-dev typescript
```

To enable TypeScript's features, we install the type declarations for React and Node.

```
npm install --save-dev @types/react @types/react-dom @types/node
```

When we run `next dev` the next time, Next.js will start looking for any `.ts` or `.tsx` files in our project and builds it. It even automatically creates a `tsconfig.json` file for our project with the recommended settings.

Next.js has built-in TypeScript declarations, so we'll get autocompletion for Next.js' modules straight away.

A `type-check` script is also added to `package.json`, which runs TypeScript's `tsc` CLI in `noEmit` mode to run type-checking separately. You can then include this, for example, in your `test` scripts.
